Debugging is where you truly learn to code. It's easy to write code when everything works, but the real growth happens when things break. This was the hardest lesson I learned when [[starting-my-cs-journey.md]].

My first approach to debugging was basically panic. I'd change random things hoping something would work. Spoiler alert: that's a terrible strategy.

The first rule of debugging: reproduce the error consistently. Whether you are building a simple script or a complex [[web-development-deep-dive.md]] application, if you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it.

I learned to read error messages carefully instead of skimming them in fear. The rubber duck method is real. Explaining your code to an inanimate object forces you to articulate your assumptions, which is often where the bugs hide.
