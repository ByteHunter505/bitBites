When I first heard the word 'algorithm,' I thought it was something incredibly complex. It turns out, algorithms are simply step-by-step procedures for solving problems.

Think about following a recipe to bake a cake. That's an algorithm. The recipe gives you inputs (ingredients), a set of instructions, and produces an output. Computer algorithms work the same way, just with data. This relationship is often why [[data-structures-explained.md]] are taught alongside algorithms—you need efficient ways to store that data.

What makes algorithms fascinating is their efficiency. Two algorithms can solve the same problem, but one might do it in seconds while the other takes hours. 

The real breakthrough for me was understanding that learning algorithms isn't about memorizing code. It's about developing a problem-solving mindset. When you understand how to break down complex problems, you become better at [[debugging-like-a-detective.md]] and writing clean code.
