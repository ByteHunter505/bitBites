If [[understanding-algorithms.md]] are recipes, then data structures are the containers that hold your ingredients. Choosing the right data structure can make the difference between code that runs in milliseconds and code that takes hours.

Arrays were my first data structure. They seem straightforward, but inserting or deleting in the middle is slow. Linked lists taught me about pointers and references.

Trees and graphs opened up a whole new dimension. These hierarchical structures model so many real-world relationships. In fact, the entire browser DOM you interact with in [[web-development-deep-dive.md]] is just one giant Tree structure!

The key lesson I learned is that there's no 'best' data structure—only the right tool for the job.
