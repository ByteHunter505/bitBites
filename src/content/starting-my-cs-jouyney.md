Every journey begins with a single step, and my computer science journey started with curiosity. I remember the first time I saw code—it looked like magic.

What drew me to computer science wasn't just the promise of a lucrative career. It was the realization that code is the closest thing we have to a superpower. With the right knowledge, you can build anything from a simple website to complex systems.

I decided to document this journey not just for myself, but for others. The path ahead is challenging, filled with late nights debugging and moments of frustration. But it's also incredibly rewarding.

My approach is simple: learn by doing. I'm starting with the fundamentals—[[data-structures-explained.md]], [[understanding-algorithms.md]], and programming paradigms. Each concept builds on the last, creating a foundation that will support everything I build in the future.

This blog will be my companion on this journey.
