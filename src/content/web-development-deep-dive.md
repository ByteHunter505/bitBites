Web development was my gateway into programming. Unlike backend programming or abstract [[understanding-algorithms.md]], the feedback loop here is instant and tangible.

I started with HTML and CSS, which felt like learning a new language. HTML provides structure, CSS adds style, and together they create the foundation of every website.

JavaScript changed everything. Suddenly, my static pages could respond to user interactions. Then came React, and my mind was blown. The component-based architecture and the virtual DOM seemed overwhelming at first, but patterns eventually emerged.

What I love most about web development is its creative aspect. You're not just solving logical problems; you're crafting user experiences.

The landscape is constantly evolving. It can feel overwhelming, but the community is incredibly supportive—something I experienced firsthand when I started my [[open-source-contribution.md]].
