Open source always felt like something for expert developers. The idea of contributing to a real project was terrifying.

I started small. I looked for issues labeled "good first issue" on a popular [[web-development-deep-dive.md]] library. I found a small bug that required some systematic [[debugging-like-a-detective.md]] to solve.

That first merged pull request felt incredible. My name appeared in the contributors list of a project I admired. It wasn't a major feature, but it was real.

Contributing to open source taught me to read and understand other people's code—a crucial skill often overlooked in tutorials. My advice to anyone hesitant: start with documentation. Once you make that first contribution, the next one is much easier.
